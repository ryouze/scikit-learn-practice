# scikit-learn-practice

scikit-learn-practice is a refresher of machine learning concepts and algorithms, following the [freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5eIE_1vpU) course.

# Installation

I'd normally create a `pyproject.toml`, automatic tests and a CI/CD pipeline, but this is just a practice repository, so let's keep it simple.

```sh
https://github.com/ryouze/scikit-learn-practice.git
```

```sh
cd scikit-learn-practice
```

```sh
python3 -m venv ./env
```

```sh
. env/bin/activate
```

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
